# Face Expression Detection using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Face Expression Detection project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (*.ipynb) that demonstrates the step-by-step process of creating a machine-learning model to detect whether a person's face is displaying a happy or sad expression.
## Introduction

This project aims to leverage the power of machine learning to recognize emotions from facial expressions. The model is trained on a dataset containing various faces and their corresponding emotions (happy or sad). By utilizing this model, you can efficiently detect whether a person's face exhibits a happy or sad expression with a high degree of accuracy.
## How to Use

    Requirements: Ensure you have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed. The Jupyter Notebook assumes you have access to common machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.

    Dataset: Prepare a folder containing a diverse set of faces displaying both happy and sad expressions. The model will use this dataset to learn the patterns associated with each emotion.

    Run the Notebook: Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (*.ipynb) and execute each cell in sequential order. The notebook will guide you through data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

    Face Expression Detection: Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the emotion of a person's face in real-time or on new images with unknown expressions.
